vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
# check for boxes available
vagrant box list
# download the shared folder and add the boxes from there 
# go to the downloaded directory and issue
vagrant box add centos_admin.box --name centos_admin
vagrant box add centos_hadoop.box --name centos_hadoop
# issue vagrant box list again to check the boxes are added
# there will also be the kafkasecmon zip file in the shared folder
# unzip that to get the kafkasecmon directtory
# go to kafkasecmon directory
# and we can bring up the machines
# admin has docker containers, kerberos krbkdc, prometheus, grafana installed
# start zookeeper on the master node
# and we can have kafka brokers started on each of the other nodes 
# master, node1, node2, node3
# to bring up a node - we have to do vagrant up <node>
# to bring up maultiple machines 
# we can do
vagrant up <m1> <m3> <m3> <m4> .....
# eg
vagrant up admin master node1 node2
# to access the machines from windows host 
# we need to add the entries to the hosts file at
c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
# may not be possible to edit the hosts file
# then in each machine, after ti has come up, add the entries to /etc/hosts
